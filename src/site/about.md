Hi, I'm Finley. I make things on the web for small businesses. Previously, I was working as a WordPress WooCommerce developer at an [eCommerce startup](https://www.allpeople.co/) and a front-end developer at [Cal Poly](https://calpoly.edu). 
I create custom WordPress websites that are fast, accessible, responsive, and SEO-optimized. 


## Services 
I am a Front-End WordPress developer who has been making websites for small businesses for over 3 years. I have experience making websites for many types of individuals and organizations - churches, nonprofits, my university, online stores,  and more. Aside from WordPress, I have worked on full web applications with strong front-end skills in JavaScript, PHP, and React with a focus on accessible and functional UI/UX. 

I won't use bloated, insecure plugins or one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter themes.

Examples of services I provide:
<ul class="dash">
    <li>Designing and developing robust WordPress websites</li>
    <li>Hosting and maintaining your website long-term</li>
    <li>Business digital strategy & search engine marketing</li>
    <li>Developing a WooCommerce or Shopify store</li>
    <li>Developing custom features and plugins</li>
</ul>



## Technologies & Tools
There's always new ways to speed up the development and design process by utilizing the right tools when you need them.
<ul class="dash">
    <li>Platforms: WordPress, WooCommerce, Shopify, Laravel</li>
    <li>Front end: React, Gatsby, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, PHP</li>
    <li>Back end: Node.js, Express, Firebase, mySQL, mongoDB</li>
    <li>DevOps and Build Tools: Nginx, Docker, npm, gulp, Yarn, Composer, Git</li>
    <li>Photo/Graphics: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, XD</li>
</ul>

## Etc

I'm also an undergraduate Political Science student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. My academic work in political science studies the effects of different social media on an individual's political knowledge and participation.
