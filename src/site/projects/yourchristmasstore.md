## Development
I migrated an old Magento 1 version of [YourChristmasStore](https://yourchristmasstore.com) to WordPress.
I also spent time doing technical SEO for YourChristmasStore.
As the sole developer, I needed to prioritize what tasks would be most influential in SEO and the ultimate goal, converting more sales.
- Migrated the Magento database, including 400+ products to WooCommerce
- Created a custom theme that improved on the previous Magento site's design
- Created 301 redirects and optimized the permalink structure for SEO
- Added 1000+ products to the store
- Provided maintenance, backups, and sales campaigns
- Synced inventory data with local store's POS system
## Logo
I redesigned YourChristmasStore's logo.
